# Module 01: ROS with Python, C++, and Rust

This directory contains study notes, code implementations, and hands-on exercises for **Module 01**, focused on core ROS (Robot Operating System) development using three distinct programming paradigms: Python, modern C++, and Rust.

---

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamental computation graph of ROS (nodes, topics, message passing).
- Implement standard publisher and subscriber patterns across Python (`rospy`/`rclpy`), C++ (`roscpp`/`rclcpp`), and Rust bindings (`rosrust`/`r2r`).
- Manage workspaces, packages, and dependency configurations using `colcon` and `cargo`.
- Compare concurrency models, memory safety, and performance trade-offs across all three languages.
